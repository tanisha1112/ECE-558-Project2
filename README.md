# ECE-558-Project2

1. a) Wrote a function to implement g= conv2(f, w, pad), where f is an input image (grey, or RGB), w is a 2-D kernel (e.g., 3 Ã— 3 box filter), and pad represents the 4-padding type clip/zero-padding, wrap around, copy edge, and reflect across edge.

b) Created a grey image of size 1024x1024 pixels that consists of a unit impulse at the center of the image (512, 512) and zeros elsewhere. 
Used this image and a kernel (e.g., selected one from (a)) to confirm that your function is indeed performing convolution. Show your filter result and explain why your function is indeed performing convolution.

2. Implementing and testing the 2-D FFT and its inverse using a built-in 1-D FFT algorithm.
